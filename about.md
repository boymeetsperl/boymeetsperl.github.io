### Where You Are!

This is a blog that I originally intended to create to help me remember cool
things that I have learned or have found interesting. The main areas that
I seem to find interesting are Programming (in all sorts of languages and all
sorts of areas) YoYo and occassionally (though it pains me to say it)
Mathematics, so naturally, those topics will likely be represented here.
Hopefully there is something interesting for you to read here, and if there
isn't, you have the whole rest of the internet to look forward to :).

### The Title
If you don't understand the title of this blog, I shall have to refer you to two
wikipedia articles. [Boy Meets World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_meets_world)
and [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).
