This is a very old video (by internet terms) but it showcases my favorite things
about yoyo: simplicity and creativity. Jensen Kimmit is not known to be the most
technically complicated yoyo players, but he is known to experiment with very
interesting stylistic elements. Anyway, watch the video it's good!
